    - Token used to connect to the API.
  binary_as_file:
    description:
    - asFile indicates that the provided binary input should be considered a single
      file within the build input. For example, specifying "webapp.war" would place
      the provided binary as `/webapp.war` for the builder. If left empty, the Docker
      and Source build strategies assume this file is a zip, tar, or tar.gz file and
      extract it as the source. The custom strategy receives this binary as standard
      input. This filename may not contain slashes or be '..' or '.'.
